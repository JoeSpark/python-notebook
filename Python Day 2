import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.show()
plt.clf() will erase the old plot so you can start afresh
plt.plot(x,y)   line, fit for time series, because time always increases so the line never goes backward. This is so because x is arrange in increasing order. If you put it in disorder, the line will go backward too.
plt.scatter(x,y)    scatter, fit for non time series, because x is not time so the line could possibly go backward
plt.hist(x, bins=n)    histogram, with n bins, each bin is equally divided, and for each bin accounts for the frequency. Default for n is 10
annotate: Add explanatory notes to or supply with critical comments."The scholar annotated the earlier version of this novel".

plt.xlabel("string")
plt.ylabel()
plt.title()
plt.xticks=([0,2,4,6,10],["0B","2B","4B","6B","10B"])    changes the ticks and the annotations
plt.xscale=('log')

plt.scatter(x, y, s=pop,c=col, alpha=0.8)   s is size, c is color, alpha is opacity\

plt.text(1550, 71, 'India')
plt.text(5700, 80, 'China')
plt.grid(True)

string could be thought of as ordered sequence, each element corresponding to an index. Element include spaces, digits, and special characters.
a/b gives floats
a//b gives integers, with the rest truncated from the real result

name[::2] select every two elements
name[0:5:2] select every two elements from index 0 to index 4, 2 is stride value
name="Michael \n Jackson" 换行
name="Michael \t Jackson" 一个很大的空格,tab
name="Michael \\ Jackson" just a \ in-between
print(r"Michael \ Jackson" a \ in-between
3 * "Michael Jackson"

A="Michael Jackson"
B=A.upper()
B=A.replace("Michael", "Janet")
A.find("el") find the first index of the sequence
